Is Discnt part of Redis?
---

No, it is a standalone project, however a big part of the Redis networking source code, nodes message bus, libraries, and the client protocol, were reused in this new project.

However while it is a separated project, conceptually Discnt is related to Redis, since it tries to solve a Redis use case in a vertical, ad-hoc way.

---

Discnt is a side project of Erik Dubbelboer.

What does Discnt means?
